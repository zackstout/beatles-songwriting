# Songwriting Secrets of the Beatles

A âœ… next to a song signifies that we have added the song to the playlist, and listened to it.

---

## Chapter 1: Tension, Resolution, and the Power of the V (p. 11)

- (p. 12) Dramatic dominants selection
- Twist and Shout

### The mechanics of the V-I change

- (p. 14) We have the V's 7th moving down a semitone to I's third, and the V's 3rd moving up a semitone to the I's root.
- We also have a descent by a fifth in the bass.

#### (a) The leading note effect

- In My Life (the melodic riff lingering on the leading tone)

#### (b) The tritone and tension

- (p. 16) It is the 3rd and 7th of the V that form a tritone, and whose resolution we most crave.

#### (c) 'Perfect fifth' root movement

- Her Majesty

### Schenker and the power of V-I

- (p. 19) Dramatic dominants selection
- Also Day Tripper and Here comes the sun

### The 5-4-3-2-1 return to base

- (p. 20) All you need is love, and I will (more disguised, 0:57)
- All together now (0:52), You've got to hide your love away (0:35)
- She came in through the bathroom window (transition into the song), orchestrates a key switch this time
- Penny lane shows how the V7 can be used to change/modulate to new keys
- Back in the USSR (intro chord)
- 'tonic-to-dominant' opening gambit in Hey Jude, Let it Be, Oh! Darling

### Beyond the V7 - extensions, additions and alterations

#### 'Extension' to a V chord: The dominant 9th chord

- If I fell (0:58)

#### 'Addition' to a V: The major 6th chord

- What you're doing (climax of bridge)

#### Alteration to a V: The augmented 5th

- 7#5 chord
- It's only love ("My oh my", 0:15)
- Oh! Darling (1:39) and From me to you (0:47)

#### The 4:3 suspension

- 7sus4 chord
- If i needed someone (0:51), For no one (0:37), Lady madonna (0:42)
- We can work it out (melody line)

#### 'Exotic intensifiers' -- the sharpened 9th, the flattened 9th

- 7#9 chord, 7b9 chord
- You can't do that (0:22)
- I me Mine (0:27)

#### 'Double' alteration to a V: The 7#5#9

- Drive my car (leaves the V hanging)

---

## Chapter 2: The Three-Chord Trick and the Blues (p. 32)

- Main idea is I-IV-V-IV-I (Wild Thing, e.g.)
- In spite of all the danger

### The 12-bar blues

- For You Blue

#### Creating the D7, G7 and A7 chords in a blues

- (p. 34) Minor pentatonic is I-b3-4-5-b7
- The b3 is the b7 of IV7, and the 4 is the b7 of the V7 (and obviously the root too).
- That's why that scale works with I7-IV7-V7 progression.

### The power of I - the one-chord trick

- (p. 36) Paperback writer, I-IV
- Ticket to Ride
- and Everybody's got something to hide, long embellishment of the tonic

### The Chuck Berry rhythm

- Simple 5 chords (2 notes)

### The IV chord

#### (a) IV-I and the Plagal cadence

- I want to hold your hand
- I saw her standing there

##### Voice leading in the Plagal cadence

- (p. 41) The IV's root moves down a semitone to become the I's third
- The IV's 3rd moves down a whole tone to become the I's fifth
- The IV's fifth is the root of I and acts as a stable point
- Yesterday and She's leaving home
- Let it be
- The end
- (p. 43) preview chapter 8: Can also approach the IV from its own IV, which is the bVII of the root

##### The IV major-to-iv minor Plagal variation

- Every time we say goodbye (Cole Porter)
- 3 semitone descent: major third of IV, to minor third, to fifth of I.
- Devil in her heart (cover of a Richard Drapkin song)
- (p. 45) "The IV-iv minor 'miracle move'" table of examples
- In My Life
- (p. 46) A few more examples from other artists...

#### (b) IV as a first destination away from the tonic

- Instead of seeing IV as transition toward I, let's reverse it.

##### I-IV -- the 'quick' change

- Love me do

##### I-IV and the connection with V-I

- (p. 47) The I-IV change is indeed descending by a fifth! Aha!
- So sometimes we dress up the I as a I7 to "prime" the change to IV

#### (c) Priming the V Chord: IV-to-V

- I want to hold your hand
- The IV is most often heard as triad, IV7 or IV9, or maybe IV6 or IVmaj7 (No Reply, Yesterday, Sexy Sadie)

### The Three-Chord Trick - revisited

- (p. 49) Beatles' success comes down to contrast between different song sections -- and often the simple I-IV-V is an important ingredient.
- Drive my car is mentioned as I-IV-V example, dressed up with jazzy chords
- Lucy in the sky with diamonds
- Hey jude
- (p. 50) Oh wow, cool analysis of lyrics as nod to structure of song -- more subtle "Hallelujah", I guess. Nod to Ger Tillekens as pioneer of this kind of insight. Neat.

## Chapter 3: The Minor Pop Chords (p. 53)

### vi, ii, iii and the elusive vii

### vi minor - the relative minor

#### The I-vi-I-vi vamp - The Beatles' first formula?

- _Misery_
- _Anna Go to him_
- _Baby it's you_
- _From me to you_
- _Run for your life_

#### Major and relative minor - making the connection

- (pg. 57) Shared notes
- Ex: A-C-E vs C-E-G

#### The four-chord cliche - I-vi-IV-V

- _Happiness is a warm gun_
- _Real love_

#### The Beatles and the I-vi-IV-V turnaround

### Diatonic substitution: the first steps

### ii minor

#### (a) The ii-for-IV subtitution in the Doo Wop cycle

- So it becomes ii-V-I-vi
- _Come go with me_

##### ii-for-IV 'relative minor for major' substitution in action

- (p. 62) Shared notes -- the ii is the relative minor of the IV
- Ex: D-F-A vs F-A-C
- _This boy_
- _Tell me why_

#### (b) The diatonic walk: I-ii and beyond

- _Don't let me down_
- _Getting better_
- _Boys don't cry_, _Like a rolling stone_

#### (c) ii-V-I - the role of ii as a 'pre-dominant'

- So, if ii is substituted for IV, we get the... ii-V-I!

##### Voice leading in a ii-V

- The 3rd of the ii wants to push up (a whole tone) to the root of the V, and its seventh wants to pull down a semitone to its third.

##### Ending a section with a prepared Perfect cadence

- _Got to get you into my life_
- _Tell me why_

##### Ending a section with an Imperfect cadence

- (p. 69) A simple ii-V to end it, leave things "hanging"
- _It won't be long_
- _Sun king_

##### The four-chord cycle revisited - ii-V-I-vi

- _How do you do it?_

### Substitution summary - the diatonic 'families'

- Tonic family (I, vi, iii): stability
- Subdominant family (IV, ii): movement away from tonic
- Dominant family (V, vii): movement toward tonic

### iii minor

- _I feel fine_
- _I'm happy just to dance with you_
- _Do you want to know a secret_
- (p. 75) the mediant is the middle point between the tonic and the dominant

#### McCartney's 'formula' - The 'iii-chord Trick'

#### The I-iii scale walk in the 12-bar blues

- _Ask me why_
- _If you gotta make a fool of somebody_
- _Help!_
- _A hard day's night_

#### The mediant and the Cycle of Fifths

##### The cycle of fifths

- _Can't buy me love_
- _Golden slumbers_
- _Moon river_ and _Fly me to the moon_, travelling around the cycle
- _The long and winding road_

#### Reversing direction - The 'vi-iii' minor drop

- (p. 83) Dropping a 4th from the vi to the iii
- _I will_
- _Please please me_
- _Across the universe_
- _There's a place_
- _Nowhere man_

#### The mediant and melody

- (p. 86) the submediant includes the "leading tone" as its stable fifth -- not just "leading" somewhere.
- _She's a woman_

### The elusive vii chord

- (P. 88) attempts to substitute the m7 for the m7b5, on the leading note -- "the most stylish and sophisticated chord we have seen"

#### The cyclical vii7

- _Here there and everywhere_

#### The pull to vi

- (p. 91) MODULATION INTRODUCED
- _Yesterday_
- _Moon river_

---

## Chapter 4: "Supercharging" a Song with Secondary Dominants (p. 97)

### Functioning secondary dominants

- The ii, iii, vi, and vii, can all be turned into secondary dominants
- The major third is indeed outside the parent major scale, but that serves to propel us forward

#### II7 (the 'V of V')

- Recall Doo Woop cliche: I-vi-ii-V
- Now replace the ii with a II7: the major third wants to resolve to the V's root.
- Like Dreamers do

#### VI7 (the 'V of ii' or 'V of II')

- In just the same way that II7 leaves to V, VI7 leads to II
- Good day sunshine
- I call your name
- Hello little girl
- Maxwell's silver hammer
- Little child
- My Bonnie
- Mr Moonlight
- Her Majesty

#### II7 and the 'Imperfect Cadence' - 'the middle feeling'

- Same idea as before: ending on the V without resolving to the I; the II7 contributes more strongly to this than the ii.
- (p. 102) See: Jingle bells?
- I will
- 'The middle feeling' table
- I'll get you
- One after 909

#### II7 and the Cycle of Fifths

- Rocky Raccoon

#### III7 (The 'V of vi' or 'V of VI')

- Well what do you: Just as II is V of V, and VII is V of II, well, the III is V of VI.
- Ain't she sweet
- Ask me why
- You can't do that
- Cry for a shadow
- No reply

#### Case Study: 'Your Mother Should Know'

- Your mother should know

#### VII7 (the 'V of iii')

- And aha! We are done! The V of III!
- Sexy Sadie
- Martha My Dear
- Moon River (and the chromatic cycle of Fifths)

#### The tonic secondary dominant 'V of IV' - The I7-IV change

- This Boy

### Non-Functioning Secondary Dominants

#### II7

- Eight days a week
- You won't see me

#### Voice-Leading in I-II-IV-I

- She's leaving home
- Yesterday
- In my life

#### III7

- _Like dreamers do_
- _I want to hold your hand_
- _Solider of Love_
- _Yes it is_
- _You're Going to lose that girl_
- _That means a lot_
- _Piggies_

#### VI7

- _Revolution_
- _Dr. Robert_

#### VII7

- _I'm so tired_
- _P.S. I Love you_

#### Case Study: "Day Tripper"

- _Day tripper_

## Chapter 5: "Exotic Birds"...and the Great Aeolian Cadence Mystery (p. 135)

- Mann's music criticism, throws out this phrase about "Aeolian Cadence" in "Not a second time"

### Surprise and the search for 'Mann's moment'

- _Not a second time_: Finding the correct "Mann's moment" in the middle, not at the end

### Playing 'tag' - The Interrupted/Deceptive cadence

- (p. 141) deceptiveness and surprise of the "Aeolian" cadence, where I is replaced by vi
- _The honeymoon song_
- _Do you want to know a secret_
- _Octopus's Garden_

### The Aeolian cadence - the search continues

- (p. 143) But he didn't say "Interrupted" or "Deceptive" cadence -- so what did he mean?
- The way the tonal center or key is being shifted during the bridge.

### What is tonality?

### The major/relative minor debate

- (p. 145) A cadence is a chord change that ends on some sense of resolution: "taking a breath".

### The Aeolian/Ionian connection

- (p. 146) Here there and everywhere, and Yesterday.
- The D7 (the V of G major) is the bVII of Em (the relative Aeolian to which we shift).

### The Aeolian cadence 'unmasked': the flattened leading note

- So instead of describing the movement as V7-vi, we can describe it as bVII7-i.
- _Not a second time_

### The Aeolian cadence in typical context

- _A Taste of honey_

### 'Tonal ambiguity' - an introduction

- (p. 149) Means "key dichotomy" or juxtaposition -- prime example being the relative/parallel minor key.
- But there is always room for subjective interpretation, with tonality.
- _Do you want to know a secret_

### Aeolian deception revisited - 'When I get home'

- _When I get home_

### The Aeolian cadence revisited - 'bVII-I' major

- _When I get home_

### Main Takeaways

#### (a) The pivot chord

- The V7=bVII7 is the pivot chord that can take us into or out of a I (into/from its relative vi as the new i).

#### (b) Modulation or Tonicisation?

- Again, a matter of ambiguity whether a particular movement is more of a local "tonicisation" or a more full-fledged modulation to a new key.
- Note that you can use the vi OR the VI7, in this context of swapping INTO a key (from the pivot chord).
- Ex: G7 (in C) can swap to Am, or A7.

#### (c) The Parallel major/minor relationship - an introduction

- The relative minor of C is Am.
- The parallel minor of C is Cm.
- Both can be used -- sometimes in same song, see _When I Get Home_

### The Mahler connection - fact or fiction?

---

## Chapter 6: Relative and Parallel Minor Switches (p. 161)

- Del Shannon's Runaway, The Ventures' Walk Don't Run, The Shadows' Apache, the Animals' The House of Rising Sun and Johnny Kid's Shakin' All Over.

#### The minor tonality - a framework for analysis

- Most Beatles songs will add a dabble of the minor key, while staying in a related major key for most of the time.

#### 'v or V'? - the dominant dilemma

- If we follow the diatonic rules, the v in a minor key is minor, not major. So (how) do we get the dominant sound?
- Usually, we break the rules and use the V7.
- Things we said today

#### Breaking the diatonic minor rules - the 'borrowed V7'

- Cayenne
- (p. 165) The V7 helps to establish the tonality of the i center -- since the whole step from original V's root up doesn't have same pull as half-step involved in the major scale version of the cadence.
- This leads us to...
- The harmonic minor scale!

### Part 1: relative major/minor switches

#### (1) The relative minor bridge

- There's a Place
- (p. 168) The V in a V7-i cadence can also be viewed as a "functioning secondary dominant" in the original I key.
- That is: The III7, which we saw is "V of vi", can also be seen as the V7 leading into the new i home.
- I'm happy just to dance with you
- I should have known better
- Don't ever change
- Example: In key of E, we have B7 as the pivot chord into C#m key.

#### 'vi at the bridge' - move or modulation?

- Examples of mere move: _Drive my Car_, _In My Life_
- Examples of true modulation: _We Can Work it out_, _When I'm Sixty Four_

#### Minor to relative major switches - a caveat

- (p. 174) cases of the opposite transition: now, an established minor is punctuated and opened up by forays into major.
- Girl, Wait, I'm Only Sleeping, You Never give me your money
- Recall Cycle of Fifths songs: Rocky raccoon, golden slumbers, your mother should know: move from relative minor to major key.

#### (2) The relative major chorus

- Girl
- I'm Only Sleeping
- Roxanne, Watching the Detectives

#### The special case of 'And I love her'

#### 'And I love her' - the final chord - a Picardy third?

- (p. 180) Picardy third: when the minor iii has its third lifted up a semitone to make it into a major triad.
- Cf. end of _A Taste of Honey_, or _Shine on you crazy diamond_

#### (a) The 'minor two-five-one': 'ii7b5-V7-i'

- The ii7b5 is rarely used, but a neat dark tone
- _You never give me your money_ (and cycle of fifths!)

#### (b) The diatonic minor Cycle of Fifths

- (p. 183): i -> iv -> bVII -> bIII -> bVI -> ii -> V
- Note that jump from bVI -> ii is just a diminished fifth (or augmented fourth), not a true fifth --
- but wasn't this also true in the original Cycle????
- _Autumn Leaves_, _I will survive_
- And again, recall Can't buy me leave and Golden slumbers from Ch. 3
- _Carry that weight_: G as the pivot chord moving us from Am to C major. (same idea we've seen a few times)

#### (c) The bVI7-V7-i resolution

- Ex: Eb7 / D7 / Gm
- The thrill is gone, Sweet dreams (Are made of this)
- _Besame Mucho_
- _I want you (she's so heavy)_

#### (d) The minor rock runs: bVI-bVII-i and i-bVII-bVI-V7

- Ex: F / G / Am in key of Am
- _The story of Bungalow Bill_, Layla, Stairway to Heaven
- Ex: Am / G / F / E7
- _Runaway_ (Del shannon), Don't let me be misunderstood, Sultans of Swing

### Part 2: parallel major/minor switches

- _I'll be back_
- _Norwegian Wood_: Has a parallel minor bridge (claimed by McCartney), cf. Michelle, whose parallel minor bridge Lennon claims
- i-bIII-bIV-V7
- _Night and day_
- _The fool on the hill_
- (p. 192) Table of other examples from Beatles songs
- _Come together_: mostly in Dm, but we emphasize the Bm chord in a way that feels like brief move to D major.
