## Chapter 3: The Minor Pop Chords (p. 53)

### vi, ii, iii and the elusive vii

### vi minor - the relative minor

#### The I-vi-I-vi vamp - The Beatles' first formula?

- _Misery_
- _Anna Go to him_
- _Baby it's you_
- _From me to you_
- _Run for your life_

#### Major and relative minor - making the connection

- (pg. 57) Shared notes

#### The four-chord cliche - I-vi-IV-V

- _Happiness is a warm gun_
- _Real love_

#### The Beatles and the I-vi-IV-V turnaround

### Diatonic substitution: the first steps

### ii minor

#### (a) The ii-for-IV subtitution in the Doo Wop cycle

- So it becomes ii-V-I-vi
- _Come go with me_

##### ii-for-IV 'relative minor for major' substitution in action

- (p. 62) Shared notes -- the ii is the relative minor of the IV
- _This boy_
- _Tell me why_

#### (b) The diatonic walk: I-ii and beyond

- _Don't let me down_
- _Getting better_
- _Boys don't cry_, _Like a rolling stone_

#### (c) ii-V-I - the role of ii as a 'pre-dominant'

- So, if ii is substituted for IV, we get the... ii-V-I!

##### Voice leading in a ii-V

- The 3rd of the ii wants to push up (a whole tone) to the root of the V, and its seventh wants to pull down a semitone to its third.

##### Ending a section with a prepared Perfect cadence

- _Got to get you into my life_
- _Tell me why_

##### Ending a section with an Imperfect cadence

- (p. 69) A simple ii-V to end it, leave things "hanging"

- _It won't be long_
- _Sun king_

##### The four-chord cycle revisited - ii-V-I-vi

- _How do you do it?_

### Substitution summary - the diatonic 'families'

- Tonic family (I, vi, iii): stability
- Subdominant family (IV, ii): movement away from tonic
- Dominant family (V, vii): movement toward tonic

### iii minor

- _I feel fine_
- _I'm happy just to dance with you_
- _Do you want to know a secret_
- (p. 75) the mediant is the middle point between the tonic and the dominant

#### McCartney's 'formula' - The 'iii-chord Trick'

#### The I-iii scale walk in the 12-bar blues

- _Ask me why_
- _If you gotta make a fool of somebody_
- _Help!_
- _A hard day's night_

#### The mediant and the Cycle of Fifths

##### The cycle of fifths

- _Can't buy me love_
- _Golden slumbers_

- _Moon river_ and _Fly me to the moon_, travelling around the cycle
- _The long and winding road_

#### Reversing direction - The 'vi-iii' minor drop

- (p. 83) Dropping a 4th from the vi to the iii

- _I will_
- _Please please me_
- _Across the universe_
- _There's a place_
- _Nowhere man_

#### The mediant and melody

- (p. 86) the submediant includes the "leading tone" as its stable fifth -- not just "leading" somewhere.

- _She's a woman_

### The elusive vii chord

- (P. 88) attempts to substitute the m7 for the m7b5, on the leading note -- "the most stylish and sophisticated chord we have seen"

#### The cyclical vii7

- _Here there and everywhere_

#### The pull to vi

- (p. 91) MODULATION INTRODUCED
- _Yesterday_
- _Moon river_

## Chapter 4: "Supercharging" a Song with Secondary Dominants (p. 97)

### Functioning secondary dominants

- The ii, iii, vi, and vii, can all be turned into secondary dominants
- The major third is indeed outside the parent major scale, but that serves to propel us forward

#### II7 (the 'V of V')

- Recall Doo Woop cliche: I-vi-ii-V
- Now replace the ii with a II7: the major third wants to resolve to the V's root.
- Like Dreamers do

#### VI7 (the 'V of ii' or 'V of II')

- In just the same way that II7 leaves to V, VI7 leads to II
- Good day sunshine
- I call your name
- Hello little girl
- Maxwell's silver hammer
- Little child
- My Bonnie
- Mr Moonlight
- Her Majesty

#### II7 and the 'Imperfect Cadence' - 'the middle feeling'

- Same idea as before: ending on the V without resolving to the I; the II7 contributes more strongly to this than the ii.
- (p. 102) See: Jingle bells?
- I will
- 'The middle feeling' table
- I'll get you
- One after 909

#### II7 and the Cycle of Fifths

- Rocky Raccoon

#### III7 (The 'V of vi' or 'V of VI')

- Well what do you: Just as II is V of V, and VII is V of II, well, the III is V of VI.
- Ain't she sweet
- Ask me why
- You can't do that
- Cry for a shadow
- No reply

#### Case Study: 'Your Mother Should Know'

- Your mother should know

#### VII7 (the 'V of iii')

- And aha! We are done! The V of III!
- Sexy Sadie
- Martha My Dear
- Moon River (and the chromatic cycle of Fifths)

#### The tonic secondary dominant 'V of IV' - The I7-IV change

- This Boy

### Non-Functioning Secondary Dominants

#### II7

- Eight days a week
- You won't see me

#### Voice-Leading in I-II-IV-I

- She's leaving home
- Yesterday
- In my life

#### III7

- _Like dreamers do_
- _I want to hold your hand_
- _Solider of Love_
- _Yes it is_
- _You're Going to lose that girl_
- _That means a lot_
- _Piggies_

#### VI7

- _Revolution_
- _Dr. Robert_

#### VII7

- _I'm so tired_
- _P.S. I Love you_

#### Case Study: "Day Tripper"

- _Day tripper_
