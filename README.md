---

## Chapter 1

- (p. 12) Dramatic dominants selection: table of examples
- ✅ Twist and Shout (each singing a note that together articulate A7, leading back to D), 1:27

### The mechanics of the V-I change

- (p. 14) We have the V's 7th moving down a semitone to I's third, and the V's 3rd moving up a semitone to the I's root.
- We also have a descent by a fifth in the bass.

#### (a) The leading note effect

- ✅ In My Life (the melodic riff lingering on the leading tone)
- The major third of the V is what leads us back to I (most strongly).

#### (b) The tritone and tension

- (p. 16) It is the 3rd and 7th of the V that form a tritone, and whose resolution we most crave.

#### (c) 'Perfect fifth' root movement

- ✅ Her Majesty, nice ii-V-I turnaround at end.

### Schenker and the power of V-I

- (p. 19) Dramatic dominants selection: table of examples
- Also Day Tripper and Here comes the sun

### The 5-4-3-2-1 return to base

- (p. 20) All you need is love, which goes G-D-Em (so we have F# in the bassline)
- ✅ I will (more disguised, 0:57)
- ✅ All together now (0:52) - pretty subtle
- ✅ You've got to hide your love away (0:35) - yeah, very pronounced
- ✅ She came in through the bathroom window (transition into the song), orchestrates a key switch this time
- ✅ Penny lane shows how the V7 can be used to change/modulate to new keys, in and out of chorus at 0:33 and 0:50
- ✅ Back in the USSR (intro chord)
- 'tonic-to-dominant' opening gambit in Hey Jude, Let it Be, Oh! Darling

### Beyond the V7 - extensions, additions and alterations

#### 'Extension' to a V chord: The dominant 9th chord

- ✅ If I fell (0:58)

#### 'Addition' to a V: The major 6th chord

- ✅ end of She Loves you (Yeah yeah yeah yeah....)
- ✅ What you're doing (climax of bridge), 1:44

#### Alteration to a V: The augmented 5th

- 7#5 chord
- ✅ It's only love ("My oh my", 0:15)
- ✅ Ask me why, 0:48
- ✅ Oh! Darling (first chord and 1:39) and
- ✅ From me to you (0:47)

#### The 4:3 suspension

- 7sus4 chord
- Used as a nice little embellishment
- ✅ If i needed someone (0:51), "now I'm too much in love..."
- ✅ For no one (0:37), "a love that should have lasted years.."
- ✅ Lady madonna (0:42), "see how they run.."
- ✅ We can work it out (melody line)

#### 'Exotic intensifiers' -- the sharpened 9th, the flattened 9th

- 7#9 chord, 7b9 chord
- ✅ You can't do that (0:22), melody creates the #9
- ✅ I me Mine (0:27), "coming on strong", same thing, melody creates it.

#### 'Double' alteration to a V: The 7#5#9

- ✅ Drive my car (leaves the V hanging), "but you can do something in between"
- The melody adds both these "color" notes

---

## Chapter 2

- Main idea is I-IV-V-IV-I (Wild Thing, e.g.)
- ✅ In spite of all the danger

### The 12-bar blues

- ✅ For You Blue

#### Creating the D7, G7 and A7 chords in a blues

- (p. 34) Minor pentatonic is I-b3-4-5-b7
- The b3 is the b7 of IV7, and the 4 is the b7 of the V7 (and obviously the root too).
- That's why that scale works with I7-IV7-V7 progression.

### The power of I - the one-chord trick

- ✅ (p. 36) Paperback writer, I-IV
- ✅ Ticket to Ride
- ✅ Everybody's got something to hide, long embellishment of the tonic

### The Chuck Berry rhythm

- Simple 5 chords (2 notes, root and fifth)

### The IV chord

#### (a) IV-I and the Plagal cadence

- ✅ I want to hold your hand (ending!)
- ✅ I saw her standing there (also ending)

##### Voice leading in the Plagal cadence

- (p. 41) The IV's root moves down a semitone to become the I's third
- The IV's 3rd moves down a whole tone to become the I's fifth
- The IV's fifth is the root of I and acts as a stable point
- Yesterday and She's leaving home
- ✅ Let it be
- ✅ The end
- (p. 43) preview chapter 8: Can also approach the IV from its own IV, which is the bVII of the root

##### The IV major-to-iv minor Plagal variation

- ✅ Every time we say goodbye (Cole Porter, 2:12)
- 3 semitone descent: major third of IV, to minor third, to fifth of I.
- ✅ Devil in her heart (cover of a Richard Drapkin song, 0:25)
- (p. 45) "The IV-iv minor 'miracle move'" table of examples
- ✅ In My Life ("all my liiiife...", 0:14)
- (p. 46) A few more examples from other artists...

#### (b) IV as a first destination away from the tonic

- Instead of seeing IV as transition toward I, let's reverse it.

##### I-IV -- the 'quick' change

- ✅ Love me do (yeah, just go to IV and hang out there)

##### I-IV and the connection with V-I

- (p. 47) The I-IV change is indeed descending by a fifth! Aha!
- So sometimes we dress up the I as a I7 to "prime" the change to IV

#### (c) Priming the V Chord: IV-to-V

- ✅ I want to hold your hand, intro and climax of bridge, changing between IV and V to delay change to I
- But all in all, the IV has many uses:
- ✅ I saw her standing there (opening moves E7-A7, a I-IV change)
- The IV is most often heard as triad, IV7 or IV9, or maybe IV6 or IVmaj7 (No Reply, Yesterday, Sexy Sadie)

### The Three-Chord Trick - revisited

- (p. 49) Beatles' success comes down to contrast between different song sections -- and often the simple I-IV-V is an important ingredient.
- Drive my car is mentioned as I-IV-V example, dressed up with jazzy chords
- ✅ Lucy in the sky with diamonds; complex overall, but simple I-IV-V chorus
- Same idea with Drive My Car
- ✅ Hey jude: IV-I-V-I
- (p. 50) Oh wow, cool analysis of lyrics as nod to structure of song -- more subtle "Hallelujah", I guess. Nod to Ger Tillekens as pioneer of this kind of insight. Neat.

---

## Chapter 3

### vi, ii, iii and the elusive vii

### vi minor - the relative minor

#### The I-vi-I-vi vamp - The Beatles' first formula?

- ✅ _Misery_ (C and Am, 1:33-1:45, ending))
- ✅ _Anna Go to him_
- ✅ _Baby it's you_
- ✅ _From me to you_ (intro, 'da da daaa da da daa daa daaaa')
- Also: All my loving, Not a second time, All I've got to do
- ✅ _Run for your life_, intro

#### Major and relative minor - making the connection

- (pg. 57) Shared notes
- Ex: A-C-E vs C-E-G
- And Am7 === C6

#### The four-chord cliche - I-vi-IV-V

- ✅ _Happiness is a warm gun_: like Lucy, breaking up complex larger thing with a familiar part.
- Often a small break from a larger theme: A Hard Day's Night, I'm So Tired, I'll Get You
- ✅ _Real love_
- (p. 60) The Beatles and the I-vi-IV-V turnaround: table of examples
- A Hard Day's Night (bridge)
- I'll Get You (verse)
- I'm So Tired (verse)
- I've Just seen a face (verse)
- Octopus's Garden

#### Diatonic substitution: the first steps

- Preview chapter 5: The vi can be used to fully replace the I.
- Or... the ii can be used to replace the IV.
- (p. 61) Because the ii is the relative minor (vi) of the IV.

### ii minor

#### (a) The ii-for-IV subtitution in the Doo Wop cycle

- Doo Wop: Four-chord cliche becomes I-vi-ii-V
- ✅ _Come go with me_

##### ii-for-IV 'relative minor for major' substitution in action

- (p. 62) Shared notes -- the ii is the relative minor of the IV
- Ex: D-F-A vs F-A-C
- ✅ _This boy_
- ✅ _Tell me why_
- ✅ (p. 64) You're going to lose that girl,
- ✅ I will,
- ✅ penny lane
- (p. 65) All a variation on the original Three-chord I-IV-I-V, adding in vi-for-I and ii-for-IV.

#### (b) The diatonic walk: I-ii and beyond

- I-ii-iii-IV-V walk
- ✅ _Don't let me down_ (I-ii)
- If I fell, I'm only sleeping (I-ii-iii)
- Here there and everywhere, Sexy Sadie (I-ii-iii-IV)
- ✅ _Getting better_ (all the way up to V)
- _Boys don't cry_, _Like a rolling stone_ (Hendrix cover)

#### (c) ii-V-I - the role of ii as a 'pre-dominant'

- So, if ii is substituted for IV, in the familiar IV-V-I, we get the... ii-V-I!
- Which descends two perfect fifths.

##### Voice leading in a ii-V

- The 3rd of the ii wants to push up (a whole tone) to the root of the V, and its seventh wants to pull down a semitone to its third.
- (p. 67) Voice leading in the iim7-V7 change
- Minor seven goes down a semitone to become 3rd of V7
- Minor third goes up a tone to become root of V7
- And the root goes down a perfect fifth to become root
- We should investigate why/how this differs from V7-I voice leading... (where 7 goes down a semitone, 3 goes up one.)

##### Ending a section with a prepared Perfect cadence

- Can use the ii-V-I to end a song or section.
- ✅ _Got to get you into my life_ ("every single day of my life...")
- ✅ _Tell me why_ (1:40, end of bridge)

##### Ending a section with an Imperfect cadence

- (p. 70) A simple ii-V to end it, leave things "hanging".
- ✅ _It won't be long_ (0:50)
- Oh Darling and
- ✅ I'm a Loser (opening)
- ✅ _Sun king_

##### The four-chord cycle revisited - ii-V-I-vi

- Start the Doo Wop sequence, I-vi-ii-V, a bar late, so it's vi-ii-V...e.g. Am-Dm-G -- no, this is wrong.
- (and it becomes a ii-V-I! -- Reinterpreting the V as new I!)
- (p. 71) So we get a ii-V-I-vi (??? -- if we actually cycle by 2 chords, and don't reinterpret V as I)
- That seems to be what we get if we start 2 bars late, not one bar late... Hmm.. I guess it's 2 chords per bar.
- ✅ _How do you do it?_ (0:32), nice "middle 8"
- ✅ All my loving (0:00-0:06),
- ✅✅ Fool on the hill (0:17-0:23), "Nobody wants to know him, they can see he's just a fool" (Em7 A7 D6 Bm6)
- (p. 72) And sure, we also see just VI-V-I-vi (I want to hold your hand)

#### Substitution summary - the diatonic 'families'

- **Tonic family** (I, vi, iii): stability
- **Subdominant family** (IV, ii): movement away from tonic
- **Dominant family** (V, vii): movement toward tonic

### iii minor

- Can be substituted for the vi in the 4 chord (I-vi-IV-V) and Doo Woop (I-vi-ii-V)
- ✅ _I feel fine_ (shows both example substitutions), nice "middle eight", "I'm so glad that she's my little girl..."
- _I'm happy just to dance with you_
- _Do you want to know a secret_ (very similar chord progressino to above)
- (p. 75) the mediant is the middle point between the tonic and the dominant
- (p. 76) McCartney's 'formula' - The 'iii-chord Trick': table of examples
- ✅ A Day in the Life - "I read the _news_ today..."
- ✅ Help! - "When I was younger so much _younger_ than today..."

#### The I-iii scale walk in the 12-bar blues

- I7-ii7-iii7-biii7-ii7-V7-I
- ✅ They call it (stormy monday), T. Bone Walker
- (p. 76) The fifth of the iii7 is the major 7 of parent key, which gives a cheerier version of the blues.
- ✅ _Ask me why_
- I-iii-vi progression:
- ✅ _If you gotta make a fool of somebody_
- ✅ _Help!_, I-iii-vi, cf. bridge of Something
- ✅ _A hard day's night_ (bridge)
- And indeed, the iii-vi is a descending fifth. What do you know! So natural progression.

#### The mediant and the Cycle of Fifths

##### The cycle of fifths

- _Moon river_ and _Fly me to the moon_, travelling around the cycle (starting at least at iii)
- ✅ _Can't buy me love_ as textbook example, intro
- ✅ _Golden slumbers_ as another one, 0:20
- _The long and winding road_

#### Reversing direction - The 'vi-iii' minor drop

- (p. 83) Dropping a 4th from the vi to the iii
- ✅ _I will_ (changing from I-vi-ii-V to I-vi-iii-V)
- ✅ _Please please me_: gorgeous example in the pre-chorus: see the C#m and F#m not as part of E, but as part of the IV, A, which is trying to assert itself.
- (p. 85) She Loves you, and
- Julia
- ✅ _Across the universe_: opening/intro, very clear I-vi-iii
- ✅ _There's a place_: nice V-iii transition
- ✅ _Nowhere man_ (iii to IV movement in chorus)
- ✅✅ Ask me why: very last chord, iii-for-I subtitution

#### The mediant and melody

- (p. 86) the submediant includes the parent scale's "leading tone", major 7, as its stable fifth -- not just "leading" somewhere.
- Using both this 7 and the blusey minor 7 is cool and fun.
- ✅ _She's a woman_, 0:38
- Melodic (natural) seventh over the iii

### The elusive vii chord

- (P. 88) attempts to substitute the m7 for the m7b5, on the leading note -- "the most stylish and sophisticated chord we have seen"
- Because, Lennon's "minor opus"

#### The cyclical vii7

- ✅ _Here there and everywhere_: verse is in G, then the F#m7b5-B7 pulls us toward Em.

#### The pull to vi

- (p. 91) MODULATION INTRODUCED: The vii descends a fifth to the III, which then descends a fifth to the vi.
- So you can use it to modulate into the relative minor (vi) key, with a "ii-V-i" move.
- ✅ _Yesterday_: uses same exact idea as Here there everywhere
- ✅ _Moon river_, another great example of this vii-III-vi move.
- Which, we reinterpret as a ii-V-i, modulating to the parallel minor scale. Nice (From E to C#m).
- So, again, the 7-3-6-2-5-1 chain can be interpreted as 2 ii-V-I groups, linked together.

---

## Chapter 4

### Functioning secondary dominants

- The ii, iii, vi, and vii, can all be turned into secondary dominants.
- The major third (of each chord) is indeed outside the parent major scale, but that serves to propel us forward.
- and also adds scope for melody from outside parent scale.

#### II7 (the 'V of V')

- Recall Doo Woop cliche: I-vi-ii-V
- Now replace the ii with a II7: the major third wants to resolve to the V's root.
- ✅ Like Dreamers do, 0:45, nice clear example of ii->II7->V7

#### VI7 (the 'V of ii' or 'V of II')

- In just the same way that II7 leaves to V, VI7 leads to II
- So Doo Wop sequence (I-vi-ii-V) becomes I-VI7-II7-V7
- ✅ Good day sunshine, verse
- ✅ I call your name, verse
- ✅ Hello little girl, intro, I-VI7-ii7-V7
- ✅ Maxwell's silver hammer, verse
- We also see I-VI7-ii-V-I
- ✅ Hello little girl, ending/postscript
- ✅ Little child, ending/coda
- ✅✅ Her Majesty
- ✅ My Bonnie
- ✅ Mr Moonlight

#### II7 and the 'Imperfect Cadence' - 'the middle feeling'

- (p. 102) Same idea as before: ending on the V without resolving to the I; the II7 contributes more strongly to this than the ii.
- (Recall It Won't Be Long)
- See: Jingle bells?
- ✅ I will: "Love you where we're apart...", II7-V7
- (p. 104) 'The middle feeling' imperfect cadence: table of examples -- extended on p. 105
- ✅ Besame Mucho, 1:08
- ✅ I'll get you, bridge, 1:09
- ✅ One after 909, bridge, 0:55

#### II7 and the Cycle of Fifths

- ✅ Rocky Raccoon: vi7-II7-V7-I, mm just nasty, the vocals

#### III7 (The 'V of vi' or 'V of VI')

- Well what do you know: Just as II is V of V, and VII is V of II, well, the III is V of VI.
- So we see III7 preparing the vi or VI7.
- 🎵 Ain't she sweet
- 🎵 Ask me why
- 🎵 You can't do that
- 🎵 Cry for a shadow
- 🎵 No reply

#### Case Study: 'Your Mother Should Know'

- 🎵 Your mother should know: vi-IV-VI7-ii-V7-I-VI7-II7-V7-I-III7 (and back to vi)

#### VII7 (the 'V of iii')

- And aha! We are done! The V of III!
- 🎵 Sexy Sadie
- (p. 113) Mr. Sandman: C-B7-E7-A7-D7-G7-C.
- 🎵 Martha My Dear
- 🎵 Moon River (and the chromatic cycle of Fifths): bV-VII7-iiim7-VI7-iim7-V7-I.
- Again, it's: 7-3-6-2-5-1.

#### The tonic secondary dominant 'V of IV' - The I7-IV change

- Casting the I chord as the "V of IV".
- 🎵 (p. 116) If I Fell, Hey Jude, Oh Darling
- 🎵 This Boy

### Non-Functioning Secondary Dominants

#### II7

- I-II(7)-IV-I
- 🎵 Eight days a week
- 🎵 You won't see me
- Stay with me, Lifestyles of the Rich and famous

#### Voice-Leading in I-II-IV-I

- (p. 118): In e.g. C-D7-F-C, a chromatic line is spelled out: G-F#-F-E.
- 🎵 (see Eight days a week)
- And we can do a vi-for-I to get vi-II-IV-I, shown in following two songs
- 🎵 She's leaving home
- 🎵 Yesterday
- 🎵 In my life (example of II-IV rather than expected II-V)

#### III7

- 🎵 _Like dreamers do_
- 🎵 _I want to hold your hand_ (The III7, a B7, propels us up to IV of C, via its F# fifth and D# third, each going up a semitone.)
- (And also exhibits the "vi-III" plunge from Em to B7)
- 🎵 _Solider of Love_
- 🎵 _Yes it is_
- 🎵 _You're Going to lose that girl_
- 🎵 _That means a lot_
- 🎵 _Piggies_

#### VI7

- (p. 126) Inherent dissonance between the major third of the VI7 and the parent key (it's the m2 interval).
- It's used in a weirdly effective but "dysfunctional" way in following 2 songs.
- 🎵 _Revolution_
- 🎵 _Dr. Robert_

#### VII7

- 🎵 _I'm so tired_
- 🎵 _P.S. I Love you_
- also the phrase C-B-C in Octopus's Garden

#### Case Study: "Day Tripper"

- 🎵 _Day tripper_: I7-IV7-I7-II7-IV7-III7-VI7-V7.
- (p. 130) Here, the III7 is the only functioning secondary dominant.
- Again, the VI7 contains the dissonant m2 interval.

---

## Chapter 5

- Mann's music criticism, throws out this phrase about "Aeolian Cadence" in "Not a second time"
- (and Mahler's Song of the Earth)
- Also discussed 'mediant switches' in I want to hold your hand, and 'melismas' of She Loves You (?)
- (p. 138) G-Em-G-Em: I-vi-I-vi

### Surprise and the search for 'Mann's moment'

- 🎵 _Not a second time_: Finding the correct "Mann's moment" in the middle, not at the end
- At 1:47

### Playing 'tag' - The Interrupted/Deceptive cadence

- (p. 141) deceptiveness and surprise of the "Aeolian" cadence, where I is replaced by vi: D7 leading not to G, but to Em
- This is the Interrupted/Deceptive cadence: dominant to relative minor, or dominant to submediant
- 🎵 _The honeymoon song_ (early cover)
- 🎵 _Do you want to know a secret_ (debut album)
- 🎵 _Octopus's Garden_ ("in an octopus's garden with you")

### The Aeolian cadence - the search continues

- (p. 143) But he didn't say "Interrupted" or "Deceptive" cadence -- so what did he mean?
- The way the tonal center or key is being shifted during the bridge.

### What is tonality?

### The major/relative minor debate

- (p. 145) A cadence is a chord change that ends on some sense of resolution: "taking a breath".

### The Aeolian/Ionian connection

- (p. 146) The equality of the Ionian and Aeolian "modes".
- Here there and everywhere, and Yesterday, and the ii-V-i sequence. (Recall Chapter 3 - yes, the "cyclical vii")
- aka the vii-III-vi sequence.
- **Key point: The D7 (the V of G major) is the bVII of Em (the relative Aeolian to which we shift).**

### The Aeolian cadence 'unmasked': the flattened leading note

- (p. 147) So instead of describing the movement as V7-vi, we can describe it as bVII7-i. Neat.
- A nice voice-leading table to show this.
  -🎵 _Not a second time_

### The Aeolian cadence in typical context

- A minor key song that uses the bVII-i move is...
- 🎵 _A Taste of honey_

### 'Tonal ambiguity' - an introduction

- (p. 149) Means "key dichotomy" or juxtaposition -- prime example being the relative/parallel minor key.
- Throws out many examples, from across all albums, of this juxtaposition.
- Much of rest of book is about this: tonal ambiguity.
- But there is always room for subjective interpretation, with tonality.
- (p. 150) Lol Lennon dismissed Mann as a 'twit'.
- 🎵 _Do you want to know a secret_, 0:38

### Aeolian deception revisited - 'When I get home'

- 🎵 _When I get home_

### The Aeolian cadence revisited - 'bVII-I' major

- (p. 152) The "V7" (e.g. G7 of C) can pull us not only toward the vi (Am) but also toward VI (A or A7).
- 🎵 _When I get home_

### Main Takeaways

#### (a) The pivot chord

- The V7=bVII7 is the pivot chord that can take us into or out of a I (into/from its relative vi as the new i).
- For instance G7 (in key of C) can take us to Am, or to A major.

#### (b) Modulation or Tonicisation?

- Again, a matter of ambiguity whether a particular movement is more of a local "tonicisation" or a more full-fledged modulation to a new key.
- Note that you can use the vi OR the VI7, in this context of swapping INTO a key (from the pivot chord).
- Ex: G7 (in C) can swap to Am, or A7.
- Wandering sense of movement, ambiguous tonality -- more propulsion and motion than a single key can offer.

#### (c) The Parallel major/minor relationship - an introduction

- The relative minor of C is Am.
- The parallel minor of C is Cm.
- Both can be used -- sometimes in same song, see _When I Get Home_

### The Mahler connection - fact or fiction?

---

## Chapter 6

- "I don't know why, it just makes me want to weep", This is Spinal Tap
- Del Shannon's Runaway, The Ventures' Walk Don't Run, The Shadows' Apache, the Animals' The House of Rising Sun and Johnny Kid's Shakin' All Over.
- Also, A Taste of Honey, Besame Mucho, I just don't understand, Three cool cats

#### The minor tonality - a framework for analysis

- (p. 162) Most Beatles songs will add a dabble of the minor key, while staying in a related major key for most of the time.
- Cayenne and Mr Kite are a few of the only pure-minor songs.

#### 'v or V'? - the dominant dilemma

- If we follow the diatonic rules, the v in a minor key is minor, not major. So (how) do we get the dominant sound?
- Usually, we break the rules and use the V7.
- 🎵 Things we said today: Am-Em7

#### Breaking the diatonic minor rules - the 'borrowed V7'

- 🎵 Cayenne: Em-Am-B7
- (p. 165) The V7 helps to establish the tonality of the i center -- since the whole step from original v's root up doesn't have same pull as half-step involved in the major scale version of the cadence.
- This leads us to...
- The harmonic minor scale!
- (p. 166) The raised 7th in the harmonic minor scale means that, when we take diatonic chords, the v becomes major (V7). That is, its third gets raised. This helps it perform its function of leading back to tonic, i.

### Part 1: relative major/minor switches

#### (1) The relative minor bridge

- 🎵 There's a Place -- first example of flirting with this tonal ambiguity.
- Recall our pivot chord from before: The I's V, equals the vi's bVII.
- This can be used in conjunction with the V-i to reinforce the minor tonality.
- (p. 168) The V in a V7-i cadence can also be viewed as a "functioning secondary dominant", III7, in the original I key.
- That is: The III7, which we saw is "V of vi", can also be seen as the V7 leading into the new i home.
- 🎵 I'm happy just to dance with you
- (p. 169) Again, we see B play the pivot chord role in key of E or C#m.
- 🎵 I should have known better
- **Shows both pivots: Uses the I's V === vi's bVII to pivot to I, and then the I's III7 === vi's V7 to pivot out of I, to vi (or, "i").**
- 🎵 Don't ever change
- Example: In key of E, we have B7 as the pivot chord into C#m key.
- And, we have G#7 as the III7 of E, who is also the V7 of the new C#m key.

#### 'vi at the bridge' - move or modulation?

- Examples of mere move:
- 🎵 _Drive my Car_,
- 🎵 _In My Life_
- Examples of true modulation:
- 🎵 _We Can Work it out_,
- 🎵 _When I'm Sixty Four_

#### Minor to relative major switches - a caveat

- (p. 174) cases of the opposite transition: now, an established minor is punctuated and opened up by forays into major.
- Girl, Wait, I'm Only Sleeping, You Never give me your money
- Recall Cycle of Fifths songs: Rocky raccoon, golden slumbers, your mother should know: move from relative minor to major key.
- Again, that was: 7-3-6-2-5-1 (which is kinda like 2 2-5-1s back to back)

#### (2) The relative major chorus

- 🎵 Girl, each key is reinforced by its dominant V7.
- 🎵 I'm Only Sleeping: uses the bVI of the i, or the IV of the I, as pivot chord, this time.
- Ex: Cb, between Eb minor and Gb major.
- (p. 178) Roxanne, Watching the Detectives

#### The special case of 'And I love her'

- E major or C# minor??
- And the final chord is a Picardy third, weird.

#### 'And I love her' - the final chord - a Picardy third?

- (p. 180) Picardy third: when the minor iii has its third lifted up a semitone to make it into a major triad.
- 🎵 Cf. end of _A Taste of Honey_,
- or _Shine on you crazy diamond_

### Part 1.5: Minor-key Progressions

#### (a) The 'minor two-five-one': 'ii7b5-V7-i'

- The ii7b5 is rarely used, but a neat dark tone
- 🎵 _You never give me your money_ (and cycle of fifths!), great example.
- Again, note the use of the bVII of the i (or the V of the I) as pivot chord.

#### (b) The diatonic minor Cycle of Fifths

- (p. 183): i -> iv -> bVII -> bIII -> bVI -> ii -> V -> i
- Note that jump from bVI -> ii is just a diminished fifth (or augmented fourth), not a true fifth --
- but wasn't this also true in the original Cycle????
- _Autumn Leaves_, _I will survive_
- And again, recall Can't buy me leave and Golden slumbers from Ch. 3
- 🎵 _Carry that weight_: G as the pivot chord moving us from Am to C major. (same idea we've seen a few times)

#### (c) The bVI7-V7-i resolution

- Ex: Eb7 / D7 / Gm
- The thrill is gone, Sweet dreams (Are made of this)
- 🎵 _Besame Mucho_
- 🎵 _I want you (she's so heavy)_

#### (d) The minor rock runs: bVI-bVII-i and i-bVII-bVI-V7

- Ex: F / G / Am in key of Am
- 🎵 _The story of Bungalow Bill_, Layla, Stairway to Heaven
- Ex: Am / G / F / E7
- 🎵 _Runaway_ (Del shannon),
- Also: Don't let me be misunderstood, Sultans of Swing
- 🎵 (p. 186) Also in the bassline of We can work it out

### Part 2: parallel major/minor switches

- Now we'll look at cases of switching not to the relative minor, but to the parallel minor.
- 🎵 _I'll be back_
- (p. 188) Using E to take us from Am to A, and the melody intermingles C and C#. Cool.
- 🎵 _Norwegian Wood_
- Has a parallel minor bridge (claimed by McCartney), cf. Michelle, whose parallel minor bridge Lennon claims
- Note how the ii-V-I takes us out of i and into I. ("so I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair...")
- i-bIII-bIV-V7 seen in Michelle, starting at "I love you, I love you, I love you..."
- 🎵 _Night and day_
- 🎵 _The fool on the hill_: great move from D major to D minor, facilitated by ii7-V7-i.
- (p. 192) Table of examples from Beatles songs
- 🎵 _Come together_: mostly in Dm, but we emphasize the Bm chord in a way that feels like brief move to D major.
- Nice fall from Bm to A to G, back to A.

## Chapter 8

- 'A mode is an inverted scale, where one of the notes from the scale functions as a starting point (tonic or root) and is the focal point of the scale.'

### (a) The Mixolydian Mode

- 🎵 Hey Jude
- The key movement is bVII-IV-I.
- The F / Eb / Bb should not be heard as in Bb, but instead as related to the F tonic.
- So this is coming from F Mixolydian.
- When lowering the 7th of the F major scale, you get Eb major as the 7th chord, instead of E dim.
- That bVII is a 'character chord' of the Mixolydian.
- And this bVII - IV - I movement is nothing other than a double plagal movement! (Eb - Bb - F)

#### The Double Plagal

- 🎵 You never give me your money
- Overall the bVII-IV-I movement is more stable than its "mirror", the II-V-I, because the IV and I share I's root.
- 🎵 With a little help from my friends: chorus, D - A - E in key of E.
- (p. 258)The Beatles 'bVII-IV-I' Double Plagal excursions - table of examples
- 🎵 intro to polythene pam
- 🎵 intro to magical mystery tour
- "verse tag" to dear prudence ("won't you come out...to play")
- 🎵 She said, she said: lyrics echo sense of being "trapped" in the chord cycle, nowhere to go
- Also features a v (Fm) that works as a ii in a ii-V-I to Eb (from Bb).
- "Turning the subdominant into the tonic can be used to signify a retreat into the inner self."
- Paradise City, "Please, please, take me home.."
- 🎵 So how come (no one loves me)

#### Beyond the Double Plagal: 'Triples' and 'Quads'

- We have: bII -> bVI -> bIII -> bVII -> IV -> I
- 🎵 Here comes the sun: "Sun, sun, sun...":
- C G D A (E7): bIII, bVII, IV, I (V7)
- 🎵 A day in the life (2:49)
- 🎵 Hey Joe, revolves around Quadri-plagal harmony.
- 🎵 Wonderwall, the Triple-plagal.

#### Rationalizing the bVII chord: Mixolydian or 'borrowed'?

- So: is the bVII Aeolian (part of the parallel minor), or Mixolydian?
- We saw that bVI-bVII-I can define the Aeolian.
- _"There is only good music, and bad music."_ - Miles Davis
- Mixolydian emerges both from blues (cf. A Hard Day's Night, b3) and country (3 and 6 and b7).
- 🎵 I'm a loser
- 🎵 Good morning, good morning

#### More Mixolydian - folk flavors, pedals and 'Indian-esque drones'

- 🎵 You've got to hide your love away
- 🎵 Norwegian Wood
- 🎵 If I needed someone
- 🎵 Got to get you into my life
- 🎵 Baby you're a rich man
- 🎵 Rain
- 🎵 Tomorrow Never knows
- 🎵 Strawberry fields forever

### (b) The Lydian Mode

- 🎵 I will
- 🎵 Blue jay way
- 🎵 Flying
- 🎵 I am the walrus
- 🎵 Julia

### (c) The Dorian Mode

- Character chord is the major IV, in a minor setting.
- Think of as a natural minor scale with a raised (natural, not flat) sixth.
- 🎵 Los Paranoias
- vamp in Cm7/F7, think of as being in C Dorian, since you don't want to use the b6 of C (Ab) over the F chord.
- 🎵 Don't bother me, also using the i - IV - i progression.
- (See: while my guitar gently weeps, run for your life, norwegian wood)
- (p. 285) Those all contain the IV -- but none contains the "brave" major 6 note in the melody.
- 🎵 A taste of honey: clearly Dorian
- 🎵 Eleanor Rigby: ambiguously Dorian or Aeolian (in E minor, using C natural in melody) (mccartney)
- 🎵 Happiness is a warm gun (lennon)
- 🎵 I me mine (harrison)
- 🎵 Wait ("it's been long time, now I'm, coming back home.."), descending melody hits both 6 and b6.

### (d) The Locrian Mode

- (p. 289) hm, maybe try to match a color with each interval...
- Metallica's "Blackened"
- "Diabolus in Musica" warnings of the Middle Ages: the tritone.
- Title track to Black Sabbath's eponymous debut, also called... "Black Sabbath"

### (e) The Phrygian Mode

- Starts on 3rd degree of scale.
- Think of as natural minor with flattened second.
- This creates a major triad on the bII, so we have i-bII...
- Spanish guitar solo to start Bungalow Bill, lol came from a Mellotron (like flutes on Strawberry fields)
- 🎵 The continuing story of Bungalow bill

#### bII and the search for 'Phrygian' and 'Neapolitan' cadences

- 🎵 Things we said today (0:23) -- 'to go to Bb was quite good', Paul lol.
- The anticlockwise circle of fifths: Am - D - G - C - F - Bb
- I - IV - bVII - bIII - bVI - bII
- 🎵 Cry baby cry
- Uses F as pivot chord from G major to Em.
- 🎵 A day in the life

#### Phrygian Trivia

- 🎵 Do you want to know a secret
- 'Super Phyrgian' cadence of bII-V7-I
- The bII is called the 'Neapolitan' chord, and indeed the 'Neapolitan Sixth' when voiced in first inversion.

## Chapter 11

- A 'handle with care' chord: often (wrongly!) assumed to be reserved for speciality jazz use.
- When none of its notes are a leading note of the following chord, it is passing.
- Otherwise, it is sub-for-dom, or dominant substitute.

### Part 1: Diminished as a passing chord

- 🎵 Like Dreamers do
- The dim7 can help to harmonize with the b5 "blue note", or all the microtones between 4 and 5. (aka, tritone city.)

#### Theory interlude: the structure of the diminished seventh

- Whole-half scale, and Half-whole scale, both give rise to dim7.
- Each contains 8, rather than the usual 7, notes.
- (p. 406) 3 minor thirds stacked up, which creates 2 tritone intervals (!).
- 🎵 The Sheik of Araby (intro)
- Substitution of vi dim7 for vi, in the typical Doo wop cliche (I-vi-ii-V)
- Has voice leading from G (fifth of C) to Gb (bb7 of Am) to F (m3 of Dm7).

#### How A dim subs for 'vi' in a Four-Chord Turnaround

- (p. 408) Rarely, we see a IV-VII7-I, to emphasize the plagal cadence.
- This can be softened with the #iv dim.

#### The #iv dim and the 12-bar blues

- I / IV / I / I / IV / #iv dim / I
- Cool voice leading from root of IV, to its sharp, and up one more to the fifth of the I.
- 🎵 Hallelujah, I love her so

#### Relating a diminished chord to a dominant 7b9

- 🎵 It won't be long
- (p. 410) A# dim7 === A7b9.
- Omg, this is what we've seen in the shapes -- the 7b9 is weird and can be construed as multiple different diminished chords!!!
- **The b9 rule: When a 7b9 chord appears, you can substitute a dim7 built on a root a semitone higher.**
- Cf. Cole Porter's "True Love"
- 🎵 The End (intro theme)
- (p. 413) The IV-#ivdim-I is a way of "supercharging" the plagal cadence.
- Instead of descending like the IV-iv-I voice leading, this one ascends. Cool "mirror image".

### Part 2: Diminished as a dominant substitute

- Since it contains double tritones, it can be substituted for multiple different dominant seventh chords.
- _The harmonic minor scale is the only scale that contains the dim 7 as a diatonic chord._
- 🎵 S.O.S. (verse), Abba
- (p. 415) The vii dim 7 (e.g. C# dim7 in D minor) has almost all same notes as the V7 (e.g. A7b9 with no root, in D minor).
- So it can function as a surrogate dominant, even outside of the harmonic minor habitat.
- And... INDEED! We can see that C# and A# are separated by a minor third.
- And we saw in previous section that A# dim7 can sub for A7b9.
- And now we see that C# dim7 can do the same thing.
- Aha...!
- And that is because of....

#### The symmetry of diminished and its inversions

- C#-E-G-Bb
- D-F-G#-B
- Eb-F#-A-C
- Notice that memorizing these 3 sequences also gives you all the tritones.
- **So, when going to D minor tonic, any of C# dim7, E# dim7, G# dim7, and Bb dim7, can function as a primary dominant substitute.**
- So if we are doing a ii-V-I in D, we are going Em-A7-D.
- Any of following can substitute for A7: C#dim, Edim, Gdim, Bbdim
- These are the vii, ii, iv, and bvi.
- These last 3 will be exemplified by I want to tell you, You won't see me, and Because.

#### Subbing for a I7 that cues a bridge on IV

- 🎵 Till there was you (1:22), one of Harrison's "most enlightened" solos
- 🎵 Blue Jay Way (0:21), the initial melody rising by 2 minor thirds.

#### Dimished for primary dominant - 'the vii dim7 of I'

- 🎵 I want to tell you (0:36)
- This song is in A, and uses E7b9 === Bdim7 to interesting effect. (built on the ii)
- 🎵 I want to tell you (0:59)
- 🎵 You won't see me (1:18), bridge, we have E7 wanting to return to A, but it becomes D dim. (built on the iv)

#### Diminished for secondary dominant - 'vii dim7 of ii, iii, and vi'

- (p. 422) Will focus on the II7, III7 and VI7, from Chapter 4.

##### #i dim - or the 'vii dim7 of ii'

- 🎵 Til there was you (0:07)
- #i dim7 can substitute for VI 7b9.
- So we see: I - #i dim7 - ii - V.
- 🎵 My Sweet Lord
- Here we see: I - #i dim7 - VI7 - ii - V.
- 🎵 Blackbird
- 🎵 Life on mars
- 🎵 Don't look back in anger
- 🎵 The tears of a clown
- 🎵 I'm not in love

##### #iv dim to V: The Imperfect Cadence revisited

- #iv dim is the most popular of all diminished chords in practice.
- It functionally replaces the II on the way to V.
- 🎵 Old Brown Shoe
- 🎵 You Know my name
- (p. 429) quick summary table
- 🎵 Michelle
- ...
- 🎵 September in the Rain

## Chapter 12

Some harmonic colors we've seen:

- 6th of Can't buy me love
- dominant 9 of This boy
- augmented thrill of Please please me
- slick diminished of It won't be long
- jazzy maj7 of Till there was you
- 9 in intro of Cry for a shadow
- 7#5 in The sheik of araby
- diminished ornamentation in Like Dreamers do
- 6/9 closer in Hello little girl

Let's look at some more wacky chords they used.

### The Gretty Chord Mystery - from Whitechapel to the World Wide Web

- The 7#9 chord, aka the Hendrix chord.
- The 7#9 chord on Till there was you, Gretty said it was used again in Michelle ("ma belle").
- (p. 458) Played on E string root with b7 and #9 on B and E strings, respectively (3 frets up from root).
- So, no! It's NOT Bbm7! It's Bb7#9!
- 🎵 Till There was you (Solo at 1:10)
- 🎵 Michelle (verse at 0:08)
- 🎵 Taxman (refrain at 1:25)
- In this case, the chord is played on the A string root, and it also known as the Hendrix chord.
- (p. 460) In both cases we have a IV 7#9.
- In Taxman, we have a bVII-IV-I, double plagal descent.
- Whereas in Michelle, we have a I-IV-bVII, double fifths descent.

### Tritone or 'Flat Five' substitution

- 🎵 Til There was you: Gm7-Gb7#9-F
- Here the Gb is replacing a C7
- Tritones become mirror images in the substituted 7th, right.
- (p. 462) So in addition to annotating things as the 'V of x', we can also say, the 'bII of x'.
- 🎵 Sexy Sadie: II7-bII7#9-I.

### Beyond the Gretty Chord - More Beatles tritone subs

- We more often see the 7b5 used as tritone substitution.
- The reason is that the b5 mirrors the root of the replaced chord.
- e.g. E7 and Bb7b5

### bII: Tritone substitution and the Phrygian cadence

- 🎵 Things we said today
- Replaces a II-V-I with a II-bII-i.
- 🎵 You're going to lose that girl
- 🎵 If I fell (intro to verse)

### More Tritone substitution - beyond the V replacement

- 🎵 Here there and everywhere
- 🎵 Back in the USSR
- 🎵 Tell me Why
- 🎵 Hello Little Girl
- 🎵 I remember You

### Polychords: more inversions, slash chords and cool cadences

- 🎵 All I've got to do

### What is a Polychord?

- 🎵 Only a Northern song: verse
- 🎵 All you need is love

### Slash chords and Combination cadences

- 🎵 The long and winding road

#### The long and winding road

#### Martha my dear

- 🎵 Martha my dear
- 🎵 Sun king
- 🎵 You never give me your money

### The special case of 'add 6' and 'minor 6'

#### The added 6th and its inversion

#### The minor 6th and its incarnations

- 🎵 Honey pie
